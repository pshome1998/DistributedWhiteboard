# DistributedWhiteboard
A collaborative whiteboard that allows multiple participants to draw simultaneously on a canvas, designed using Java sockets.


This implementation of collaborative whiteboard provides features such as : freehand drawing, inputing text, drawing shapes such as lines, circles, triangles, rectangles. It also provides a file menu with New, Open, Save and SaveAs options, to be controlled only by the manager (in this implementation it is the Server). The application also provides a chat box function to enable communication between users. Sockets and threads are the lowest level of abstraction used in this project for network communication and concurrency.
